# WordPress/MySql/NGINX fabfile

This is a fabfile for [Fabric](https://github.com/fabric/fabric) that makes installing WordPress, MySQL or a blank NGINX server dirt simple.

## Caveats
- Your setup needs to be configured properly before this works. NGINX doesn't use the `sites-available/sites-enabled` setup out of the box, so you'll need to configure that, along with other stuff I'm sure I missed.
- The MySQL function only stores the randomly created credentials in the wp-config file, so don't lose it.

## Cool things
- It automatically creates a more secure wp-config.php file when you install WP. It creates and replaces the `salt` stuff, and it creates a randomly generated `wp_` prefix instead of the default.
- I'm super stoked about the git stuff in the wordpress function. It automatically grabs the latest stable tag from WordPress' [github mirror](http://github.com/WordPress/WordPress), a feat other people said wasn't possible. I thumb my nose at thee!
